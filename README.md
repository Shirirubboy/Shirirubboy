- 👋 Hi, I’m Cyril
- 👀 I’m interested in bouldering and strolling around my city in this time of corona.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing much but time to grow again my skills. So let's say swift for mobile app development. And some html/css/js for web app development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would make our Earth a better world for everyone.
- 📫 How to reach me ... reach to my heart. Hum, I'm in a peace and love mood today.
Maybe, just message me on stackoverflow.
